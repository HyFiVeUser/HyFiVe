# Reference to Basic Logger

The mechanic hardware is almost the same for the basic and the modular version of the logger. For a detailed description of this topic please go to '01_Logger/01_Basic_Logger/02_Mechanics'.

# Differences to Basic Logger
There are only two differences to the basic logger:

## Electronic Mounting
As the PCBs differ between the logger versions, their 3D-printed mountings differ as well. The mounting for the modular logger is published in this folder.

## Self-Designed Penetrators for Charging and Integration of LED and Magnetic Sensor
The end cap of the modular logger, which is not equipped with sensors, is used to contain additional functionalities. Therefore the blank end caps need to be postprocessed according to the drawing in this folder. 

For charging batteries without opening the pressure housing, charging contacts need to be fed through the end cap. For this purpose, we designed a penetrator which offers 2 O-ring grooves, a flange to rest on the outside, a M10 thread for securing on the inside and a drill hole of 4 mm diameter to receive a banana plug. On the inside a wire is connected to the penetrator, by soldering it to an extension of a washer. 

A feedback LED is integrated by placing it into a partly drilled hole in a white end cap. The remaining wall thickness is thick enough to meet the pressure requirements and small enough to transmit enough LED light. 

Close to the LED a magnetic sensor (REED switch) is positioned, e.g. for resetting the logger. A small 3D printed mounting can be used to fix it in position (or some hot glue). LED and magnetic sensor are positioned in the middle of the end cap, so the operator knows where to find look for a signal or place the magnet.
