## Creating a Config File: The Configuration Interface

We engaged a external software company to develop an interface. The interface has the following functionalities: 
- Gives an overview of all loggers:
    - Currently assigned deck box and vessel
    - Status information
        - Battery remaining
        - Memory remaining
    - Last position shown on map
- Change config parameters of loggers:
    - including sensor information
    - Creating new config files
    - Also writing changes in relational data base
- Create config files and database entries for new loggers and sensors
